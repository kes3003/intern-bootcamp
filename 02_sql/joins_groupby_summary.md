# Week 1 â€“ SQL Joins, Grouping & Aggregation

## Learning Focus
- JOIN operations: **INNER**, **LEFT**, **RIGHT** and how they differ  
- Using **GROUP BY** and **HAVING** for aggregations  
- Writing **CTEs (WITH clauses)** and subqueries  
- Summarizing data for business reporting  

---

## Tasks
1. Combine data across `orders`, `customers`, and `products`.  
2. Compute metrics such as:  
   - Total revenue  
   - Average order value  
   - Sales by product category  
3. Use **CTEs** for top-performing customers & categories.  
4. Add clear comments explaining each query block.
