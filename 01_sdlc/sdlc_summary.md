# ðŸ“˜ SDLC Summary

## 1. Requirement Gathering
- Understand what the user or client truly needs.
- Identify goals, features, and constraints.
- Example: For a food delivery app, defining requirements like "users should be able to track orders in real time."

---

## 2. System Design
- Plan the architecture, data flow, and technology stack.
- Define databases, APIs, and UI flow.
- Example: Designing separate modules for customer app, delivery app, and admin dashboard.

---

## 3. Development
- The actual coding phase where features are built according to the design.
- Version control (Git) ensures collaboration and code tracking.
- Example: Developers implement APIs for order creation, payment, and tracking.

---

## 4. Testing
- Validate that the system works as expected.
- Includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
- Example: QA tests if orders appear correctly in the app and whether payment confirmations are reliable.

---

## 5. Deployment
- Push the application to production or release to end-users.
- May involve CI/CD pipelines and environment setup.
- Example: Deploying the app to AWS or Heroku, making it live for customers.

---

## 6. Maintenance
- Post-deployment support: fixing bugs, scaling systems, and adding new features.
- Example: Updating delivery tracking speed or optimizing database queries after launch.

---

## Agile & Scrum in Practice
- Agile focuses on iterative delivery â€” working software in small increments.
- **Scrum roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- **Ceremonies:** Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review, Retrospective.
- Example: Each 2-week sprint delivers a usable feature (like order tracking or profile editing).

## Key Takeaways
- SDLC ensures structure and quality in software projects.
- Agile improves adaptability and collaboration.
- Version control with Git maintains project integrity.
- Documentation builds clarity and accountability across teams.
